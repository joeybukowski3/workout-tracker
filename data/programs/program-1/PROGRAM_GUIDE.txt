Goals: Maintain weight, build lean muscle, rotational power, core strength, flexibility, visible abs
Training Days: Monday-Friday (main), Saturday (optional), Sunday (rest)
Location: Planet Fitness

WEEKLY SCHEDULE STRUCTURE
--------------------------
Monday: Upper Body Push + Rotational Core (60 min + 15-30 min bonus)
Tuesday: Lower Body + Hip Mobility (60 min + 15-30 min bonus)
Wednesday: Upper Body Pull + Anti-Rotation Core (60 min + 15-30 min bonus)

PRE-WORKOUT ROUTINE (Every Day)
--------------------------------
Before viewing workout tables:
- 15 min Incline Walk (3.0-3.5 mph, 5-8% incline) + general stretching
- Then complete day-specific 5-10 min stretch routine (in CSV tables)
- Total warm-up time: ~20-25 minutes before main workout

TEMPO NOTATION EXPLAINED
-------------------------
Format: [Eccentric]-[Bottom Pause]-[Concentric]-[Top Pause]
Example: 3010 = 3 sec lowering, 0 sec pause, 1 sec lifting, 0 sec pause at top
- Slower eccentrics build strength and control
- Pauses increase time under tension
- "Explosive" = move as fast as possible with control

6-WEEK PROGRESSION PROTOCOL
----------------------------
WEEKS 1-2 (Foundation Phase)
- Use moderate weight (could do 2-3 more reps per set)
- Focus on perfect form and tempo control
- Establish baseline strength
- Full recovery between sets

WEEKS 3-4 (Build Phase)
- Increase weight by 5-10% OR add 1-2 reps per set
- Push closer to failure (1-2 reps left in tank)
- Maintain strict form
- If form breaks, reduce weight

WEEKS 5-6 (Peak + Deload)
Week 5: Highest intensity
- Maximum weight while maintaining form
- Push to technical failure (stop before form breakdown)
- May reduce reps to 6-8 on main lifts if needed

Week 6: Deload for recovery
- Reduce weight by 20-30%
- Keep reps/sets same, but lighter and faster
- Focus on movement quality and mobility
- Prepares body for next 6-week block

AFTER 6 WEEKS: EXERCISE ROTATION
---------------------------------
Rotate exercise variations to prevent adaptation:
- Incline Press → Flat Press → Decline Press
- Lat Pulldown Wide → Neutral Grip → Underhand
- Leg Press → Smith Squat → Bulgarian Split Squat emphasis
- Keep core rotation exercises consistent (golf-specific)

NUTRITION GUIDELINES (Maintain 195 lbs + Build Muscle)
-------------------------------------------------------
Daily Targets:
- Calories: 2,800-3,000 (adjust based on weekly weigh-ins)
- Protein: 180-200g (0.9-1.0g per lb bodyweight)
- Carbs: 300-350g (fuel for training and recovery)
- Fats: 80-90g (hormone production and joint health)

Timing:
- Pre-workout (60-90 min before): Carbs + moderate protein (oatmeal + protein shake)
- Post-workout (within 60 min): Protein + carbs (40g protein, 60g carbs)
- Distribute protein across 4-5 meals (~40g per meal)

Hydration:
- Minimum 100 oz water daily
- Add 16-20 oz per hour of training
- Consider electrolytes if sweating heavily

KNEE SAFETY MODIFICATIONS
--------------------------
Your ACL/meniscus history requires these protocols:
1. Always warm up hips, ankles, and knees thoroughly
2. Keep knees tracking over toes (avoid valgus collapse)
3. Avoid deep knee flexion under heavy load (stay above 90°)
4. No jumping, box jumps, or high-impact plyometrics
5. Stop any exercise immediately if knee pain occurs
6. Prioritize single-leg work for stability
7. Strengthen glutes and VMO to support knee joint

Safe Exercise List:
✓ Leg Press (feet mid-platform, controlled tempo)
✓ Bulgarian Split Squats (control depth)
✓ Romanian Deadlifts (hinge, not squat)
✓ Leg Curls and Extensions (moderate weight, no momentum)
✓ Goblet Squats (slow eccentric, moderate depth)
✓ Step-Ups (controlled pace, appropriate height)

Avoid:
✗ Deep barbell back squats (below parallel)
✗ Heavy leg press with feet low on platform
✗ Twisting under load (rotational lunges with weight)
✗ Box jumps or jump squats
✗ Running (use elliptical or incline walk instead)

VISIBLE ABS STRATEGY
--------------------
This program includes 4 ab-building strategies:

1. DIRECT AB WORK (visible definition)
- Decline sit-ups, weighted crunches, hanging leg raises
- Progressive overload: add weight or increase reps weekly
- Train abs 4x per week with varying rep ranges

2. ANTI-ROTATION CORE (deep core and obliques)
- Pallof presses, bird dogs, plank variations
- Builds the "frame" that abs sit on
- Improves posture and prevents lower back pain

3. ROTATIONAL POWER (golf-specific + oblique definition)
- Cable woodchops, medicine ball slams, Russian twists
- Develops oblique definition and athletic power
- Directly transfers to golf swing speed

4. TOTAL CORE INTEGRATION (overall stability)
- Compound lifts (deadlifts, rows, overhead press)
- Carries and loaded movements
- Builds functional core strength

Ab Visibility Timeline:
- Weeks 1-2: Increased core strength, improved posture
- Weeks 3-4: Beginning definition in upper abs
- Weeks 5-8: Visible upper abs, emerging obliques
- Weeks 9-12: Full six-pack definition (with diet adherence)
- Note: Abs are made in the kitchen - maintain 12-15% body fat

FLEXIBILITY MAINTENANCE WHILE BUILDING STRENGTH
------------------------------------------------
Critical for golf performance:

Daily Flexibility Work:
- Pre-workout: Dynamic stretching (in CSV tables)
- Post-workout: Static stretching (bonus sections)
- Before bed: 10 min gentle stretching routine

Weekly Priority Stretches:
1. Hip Flexor Stretch (daily) - counteracts sitting, improves swing
2. Thoracic Rotation (4x/week) - essential for golf rotation
3. Hamstring Stretch (3x/week) - protects lower back
4. Lat and Shoulder Stretch (3x/week) - maintains range of motion
5. Pigeon Pose (2x/week) - deep hip opener

Flexibility Training Days:
- Thursday: Built-in flexibility emphasis
- Saturday: Optional deep stretch session
- Sunday: Gentle yoga or restorative stretching

DO NOT skip flexibility work - it's as important as lifting for golf performance

ROTATIONAL POWER DEVELOPMENT
-----------------------------
Golf-specific movements integrated throughout:

Core Rotation Exercises (Train 3-4x per week):
- Cable Woodchop High-to-Low (downswing pattern)
- Cable Woodchop Low-to-High (backswing pattern)
- Pallof Press (resist rotation = stability)
- Medicine Ball Rotational Slams (explosive power)
- Landmine Rotations (loaded rotation)
- Cable Row to Rotation (pull + rotate)

Progression for Power:
1. Master stability (Pallof press, anti-rotation)
2. Build controlled rotation (cable woodchops, tempo)
3. Add explosive power (medicine ball, faster tempo)
4. Increase load progressively (heavier cables/DBs)

Power Transfer to Golf:
- Increased clubhead speed (5-10 mph potential gain)
- Better weight transfer through swing
- Reduced injury risk from rotational stress
- Improved consistency and ball striking

RECOVERY AND INJURY PREVENTION
-------------------------------
Essential protocols:

Daily:
- 8+ hours sleep (non-negotiable for muscle growth)
- 100+ oz water
- Post-workout nutrition within 60 min
- Evening stretching routine (10 min)

Weekly:
- Sunday complete rest
- Saturday optional light activity
- Foam rolling 2-3x per week (post-workout or evening)
- Monitor soreness and fatigue levels

Monthly:
- Deload week every 4th week OR after 6-week block
- Assess mobility and address restrictions
- Check body composition and adjust nutrition
- Review progress and adjust program if needed

Warning Signs (Stop and Assess):
- Sharp joint pain (especially knees)
- Decreased range of motion
- Persistent muscle soreness (>3 days)
- Sleep disruption or fatigue
- Loss of appetite
- Strength regression

If warning signs appear: Take 2-3 days complete rest, then resume at lower intensity

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
--------------------------

Q: Can I do cardio on this program?
A: Yes, but keep it low-impact:
- Incline walking: Daily 15-20 min (built into warm-up)
- Elliptical: 2-3x per week, 20-30 min moderate pace
- Bike: Alternative to elliptical
- Swimming: Excellent recovery day option
- AVOID: Running, HIIT, high-impact (knee stress)

Q: What if I miss a workout?
A: Continue with next scheduled day. Do NOT try to "make up" workouts.
If you miss 2+ consecutive days, resume where you left off but reduce weight by 10% for safety.

Q: Can I train upper body more frequently?
A: This program already has high upper body frequency (3x per week).
More is not better - recovery is when muscle grows.

Q: How do I know if I'm getting stronger?
A: Track main lift weights weekly. If progressing 5-10 lbs every 2-3 weeks on compounds, you're building strength.

Q: What if an exercise hurts?
A: Stop immediately. Use listed substitute. If substitute also hurts, skip that movement pattern and consult a professional.

Q: Should I do the bonus work every day?
A: Bonus work is optional. Do it when you have time and energy. Prioritize the main 60 min workout - that's where results come from.

Q: How long before I see results?
A: Strength: 2-3 weeks
Ab definition: 4-6 weeks (with diet)
Golf performance: 3-4 weeks
Body composition: 6-8 weeks
